This maze system, powered by the Haply device and its dual-sphere magnetic control mechanism, establishes a non-contact haptic feedback interface: the pink sphere maps the userâ€™s input, while the blue sphere is guided forward by simulated magnetic attraction. Players must delicately manipulate the controller sphere to navigate the blue sphere through progressively narrower and more complex maze paths, all within a simulated physical environment governed by gravity and friction. The integration of virtual coupling, physics-based control, and responsive visual feedback results in an immersive and challenging haptic navigation experience.
